Scratch notes for how to work with nbdev

turning notebooks into docs
- put them in the /nbs folder (I changed the settings.ini) to make that so
- set github pages to look into the docs folder of master branch
- run cli: nbdev_build_docs which will build all the docs in the nb folder

changing settings
- typically this can be done through settings.ini
- use nbdev_build_lib in terminal if you change something in that file (say the github repo url)
