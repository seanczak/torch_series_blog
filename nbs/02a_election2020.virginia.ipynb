    "# What in the World Happened in Virginia Tuesday Night?!\n",
    "> Statistics breaks when your sample is biased\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most American families, Tuesday night my mom and I closed up work around 5pm, heated up some leftovers, and  huddled around a TV to commence what would turn into a long night of bingeing/\"playing along at home\" with the election results.  Most of our analytics fix was generously provided for by CNN (oop, just called ourselves out with that one).  But we're not your ordinary group of sheep-le over here. No no, we're some of the more savvy consumers of click-bait information. We also used the Google!! And what we (and many others probably) noticed early on, was that there was a discrepancy between Google's little macro (powered by AP) and CNN's classic US map dashboard (although it definitely is getting fancier). The numbers being reported were the same but a difference in information delivery paradigm caused an interesting bit of confusion in our household.  Allow me to explain... \n",
    "\n",
    "If a state had more Republicans votes at the time, CNN would shade it red (or blue for the opposing case) which gave the impression that the candidate had won or at least was \"winning\" the state.  Fine, makes sense.  However, Google took it one step further. They provided two \"grades\" of shading!  A light color meant the candidate was leading the popular vote of that state whereas a darker won meant that the candidate had \"won\" the state.  Tip of the hat for the addition of this clever, intuitive visualization feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"election/election_images/google.png\" width=600 height=600 />\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's the problem? Shouldn't the candidate that is winning the state's popular vote be the one whom the analytics-gods inevitably deem as the \"winner\" of that state? Not necessarily.  Take Virginia for example. Sometime around 8:30pm EST Biden was losing by ~20%. As the CNN anchors were stewing about how Biden needed to make some sort of heroic effort to save this \"blue\" state from flipping (as if that's how election night worked), Google's map filled in dark blue signifying that not only was Biden winning Virginiaâ€¦ he'd won!! Well now as you can imagine this caused a bit of confusion around here and I decided to investigate."

    "## Setting the scene\n",
    "At around 8:30pm EST, state officials had counted 33% of votes and Biden was losing by 20%.  However, the Google macro had shaded this state dark blue to signify an unquestionable Biden victory.  Ok, what the heck?  My mom felt that way and it wasn't helped by the television pundits who kept the game-show illusion going with the rhetoric that \"hopefully Biden pulls back in Virginia.\"  The statisticians knew something that we as viewers were not being told.\n",

    "## Marbles again?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical modeling is all about simplifying the real world. In another post, we pretended that instead of going to various polling offices, mail boxes, etc, the people cast their votes by bringing a marble of a specific color (red or blue) to one big-ol marble bag located in the state's capital on election day.  We showed that if the bag was well mixed, we would only need to draw a few thousand to make a really good guess as to what the composition of the bag was.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can see how this is unrealistic because, in real life, there is more than one bag of marbles. In fact, there are 133 counties and over 2500 precincts in Virginia.  If we were to use the one bag model, we'd make the eggregious error of assuming that we could draw from any of these bags and make a general statement about the entire state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well why not?  That's how the information is displayed to us through the media?  33% of votes have been counted people!  That's well over our 10,000 marble threshold that we mathematically posited would be sufficient. Trump won Virginia folks...close the books!\n",

    "So in lies the real work of a professional statistician: choosing representative samples is hard. \n",

    "## Great...Marble Bags within Marble Bags\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's say that we needed to say SOMETHING even though we knew that our sample was biased.  Well, what if instead of assuming a single bag of votes, we assumed that each county was a smaller bag within that bag. Yes, the state's marble bag is actually a bag of county marble bags (the rabbit hole continues!). "

    "But does this explain what happened Tuesday? Well let's look at the data.  I took some numbers directly off the Virginia state's official election reporting website sometime on 11/5 (votes should be in at that time).  The final count at that time said that Biden had been awarded 53% of the counted votes.  Recalling Tuesday night, CNN would've had us believing that this was some sort of heroic push but I think the statisticians would argue that it was inevitable. Let's see."

    "\n",
    "Ok let's start by doing a quick thought experiment to see if we can recreate the situation we saw at 8:30pm on Tues when Biden was losing by 20% but was declared the winner.  Let's pretend that 10,000 votes are counted from each county (i.e. ~1.5 million of Virginia's ~4.5 million total votes).  The following is a plot of 30 randomly selected counties in Virginia and how they might've looked after counting their first 10,000 votes. (I've put a box around Fairfax County because it becomes important later - stay tuned.)"

    "If I add up the votes from all the counties, we can see that Trump would have a commanding lead over Biden at this early stage (shown on the left below).  However, the statisticians look at the early estimate of the individual counties above and realize that Trump has already lost. How?\n",
    "\n",
    "What they might've done is they take the votes that they've already counted and guess the proportion of the future votes. In fact, if we think we know how many people will vote we can use use Bayesian inference to infer a range of potential votes for each county (by inferring a range on $p$ like we did with Illinois).  Then just repeat the process for each county and add up the totals for the low and high estimate cases (right figure). And with that, you can see that even the unimaginably worst case scenario for Biden (labeled \"low\" below), he still is well above the red \"line to win\" drawn at 50% of the votes."

Well, let's just look at the raw results from the 30 most populous counties and I feel like the answer should be obvious.  Check out how many votes Biden picked up in Fairfax County. In fact, he won the top 12 most populous counties in Virginia (in some cases by a landslide)."
