    "At some point in their careers, all data scientists have suffered from a case of what I like to call \"The Datetime Blues.\"  They come when you least expect. You've worked hard to scrape data from somewhere or query it from some loosely maintained internal database and you feel ready to go. You're super excited to dig into the data, start making some visualizations, forming/testing hypotheses, and get some quick results back to your stakeholders about a project's scope.  However, after importing the data you realize its stored in one of the time formats that you're not 100% familiar with. Ok fine, a quick stackoverflow search and the dataset is ready...right?  Well, not exactly. You then realize that all your metadata is a different time format. Ok, a few more stackoverflow searches and you're up and running again.  \"WHAT NO?! Why did this python package add an extra 56 minutes when converting from local time to UTC?!?\"  Yes my friend, you have a case of the datetime blues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately this only occurs every so often in my work. But it happens just frequently enough to be annoying and just infrequently enough that I forget all the stackoverflow insights I learned the last time I dealt with the problems.  Thus, for my own sake if not yours, I want to put in writing some of the little hiccups and solutions I've come across while working with datetime objects in python and pandas.  I'll probably be adding to this piece so please provide any feedback in the comments. :)"

    "# Opinion: \"Time since epoch\" vs \"Datetime\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the code, I would like to mention that, in my experience, a reasonable first step in any time series analysis project is to immediately convert everything into seconds (or milli-/microseconds) since epoch. (Note that by definition, epoch is: `00:00:00 UTC Jan 1, 1970`.) There are several reasons for this but the ones that I find most pertinent are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an `int` object is much smaller than a `datetime` or a `str` object. This leads to all sorts of benefits such as smaller storage footprint, faster querying, simpler computation, etc.\n",
    "- epoch time is timezone independent by its nature. There is no need to ever track down a missing bit of timezone information because it's unclear if it's omission implies UTC or simply a lapse of documentation\n",
    "- if you work with machine learning models, they understand `int`s but not `datetime` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I typically work with epoch time unless I have some reason to use/see the exact date and time (e.g. visualizations, sanity checks, etc).  However, it's not always clear on how to translate between epoch time and datetime.  To further complicate matters, there are some projects that may require multiple transformations back and forth between the two formats."

    "Despite the above reasons, my human brain still understands datetimes better and, thus, when initiating a timestamp or datetime object (say, for the sake of toy demonstrations for a blog post), I typically start with a datetime representation. However, if I use a datetime object, it is important to make sure that it is \"timezone-aware.\" One of the more ...ahem, enjoyable... aspects of working with datetimes in python is that there are multiple packages to choose from and they all have their own strengths, limitations, and strange nuisances to watch out for. For example, I use `datetime` as the main workhorse of my analysis but I use `pytz` to handle the timezone information of those `datetime` objects.  By way of example, let's initiate an unaware datetime object for `9/13/2019` at `8:10:25am`."

However, this returns nanoseconds so we need to then account for that by dividing by 1e-9 (which in turn pandas converts to a `float` and then displays with scientific notation). Thus, if you're ultimate goal is a column with type `int` of seconds, you would need to cast it back to `int` again after this rescaling."
