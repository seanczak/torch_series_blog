<h2 id="Setting-the-scene">Setting the scene<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-the-scene"> </a></h2><p>At around 8:30pm EST, state officials had counted 33% of votes and Biden was losing by 20%.  However, the Google macro had shaded this state dark blue to signify an unquestionable Biden victory.  Ok, what the heck?  My mom felt that way and it wasn't helped by the television pundits who kept the game-show illusion going with the rhetoric that "hopefully Biden pulls back in Virginia."  The statisticians knew something that we as viewers were not being told.</p>
<h2 id="Marbles-again?">Marbles again?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Marbles-again?"> </a></h2><p>Mathematical modeling is all about simplifying the real world. In another post, we pretended that instead of going to various polling offices, mail boxes, etc, the people cast their votes by bringing a marble of a specific color (red or blue) to one big-ol marble bag located in the state's capital on election day.  We showed that if the bag was well mixed, we would only need to draw a few thousand to make a really good guess as to what the composition of the bag was.</p>
<p>However, you can see how this is unrealistic because, in real life, there is more than one bag of marbles. In fact, there are 133 counties and over 2500 precincts in Virginia.  If we were to use the one bag model, we'd make the eggregious error of assuming that we could draw from any of these bags and make a general statement about the entire state.</p>
<p>Well why not?  That's how the information is displayed to us through the media?  33% of votes have been counted people!  That's well over our 10,000 marble threshold that we mathematically posited would be sufficient. Trump won Virginia folks...close the books!</p>
<p>So in lies the real work of a professional statistician: choosing representative samples is hard.</p>
<h2 id="Great...Marble-Bags-within-Marble-Bags">Great...Marble Bags within Marble Bags<a class="anchor-link" href="#Great...Marble-Bags-within-Marble-Bags"> </a></h2><p>But let's say that we needed to say SOMETHING even though we knew that our sample was biased.  Well, what if instead of assuming a single bag of votes, we assumed that each county was a smaller bag within that bag. Yes, the state's marble bag is actually a bag of county marble bags (the rabbit hole continues!).</p>

<p>But does this explain what happened Tuesday? Well let's look at the data.  I took some numbers directly off the Virginia state's official election reporting website sometime on 11/5 (votes should be in at that time).  The final count at that time said that Biden had been awarded 53% of the counted votes.  Recalling Tuesday night, CNN would've had us believing that this was some sort of heroic push but I think the statisticians would argue that it was inevitable. Let's see.</p>

<h2 id="Asking-the-data">Asking the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Asking-the-data"> </a></h2><p>Ok let's start by doing a quick thought experiment to see if we can recreate the situation we saw at 8:30pm on Tues when Biden was losing by 20% but was declared the winner.  Let's pretend that 10,000 votes are counted from each county (i.e. ~1.5 million of Virginia's ~4.5 million total votes).  The following is a plot of 30 randomly selected counties in Virginia and how they might've looked after counting their first 10,000 votes. (I've put a box around Fairfax County because it becomes important later - stay tuned.)</p>

<h2 id="Tale-of-two-Virginias">Tale of two Virginias<a class="anchor-link" href="#Tale-of-two-Virginias"> </a></h2><p>If I add up the votes from all the counties, we can see that Trump would have a commanding lead over Biden at this early stage (shown on the left below).  However, the statisticians look at the early estimate of the individual counties above and realize that Trump has already lost. How?</p>
<p>What they might've done is they take the votes that they've already counted and guess the proportion of the future votes. In fact, if we think we know how many people will vote we can use use Bayesian inference to infer a range of potential votes for each county (by inferring a range on $p$ like we did with Illinois).  Then just repeat the process for each county and add up the totals for the low and high estimate cases (right figure). And with that, you can see that even the unimaginably worst case scenario for Biden (labeled "low" below), he still is well above the red "line to win" drawn at 50% of the votes.</p>

<p>Ok, for those of you who followed all the way up until now you might still be asking: how could this be? Well, let's just look at the raw results from the 30 most populous counties and I feel like the answer should be obvious.  Check out how many votes Biden picked up in Fairfax County. In fact, he won the top 12 most populous counties in Virginia (in some cases by a landslide).</p>

<p>Of course, votes aren't actually counted at the same speed and my little model I presented here isn't actually the numbers from Tuesday night (8:30pm). But... it shows that while the public is being fed one story about Trump leading by 20%, the statisticians have already realized he doesn't have a prayer of winning Virginia.</p>
<p>Well this is all very interesting, but what about swing states? And, this is not doing a whole lot to convince me whether or not my vote counts.  I'd argue that it does but this post is getting a bit long.  I try to answer those questions in greater detail in other posts.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! Would appreciate any feedback!</p>
